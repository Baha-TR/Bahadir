# This is a tutorial repository. I will be learning python through several books and courses. I try to save my finished codes here to monitor my improvement.
# My goal is to become adequate in  scientific computing to run several FEM analysis. My guess is, by the end of 2021, I will be running CFD analyzes and simulations as well as structural analyzes.
